    <h2>Bluebird</h2>
    <p>there,s a bluebird in my heart that <br>
        wants to get out <br>
        but i'm too tough for him,<br>
        i say, stay in there, i'm not going <br>
        to let anybody see <br>
        you. <br>
        there's bluebird in my heart that <br>
        wants to get out <br>
        but i pour whiskey on him and inhale <br>
        cigarette smoke <br>
        and the whores and the bartenders <br>
        and the grocery clerks <br>
        never know that <br>
        he's <br>
        in there. <br>
